Originally, CAPTCHA stands for \"Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart\", and traditional CAPCTHAs serve as a great tool to stop spam bots and malicious crawlers. Today, as we have made huge progress in computer vision and deep learning, these CAPCTHAs are no longer unbreakable by computers. Now let's prove the correctness of the claim by ourselves!\n",
