        "\n",
        "Welcome to Lab 7 of EE 467! Today we apply the machine learning techniques you’ve learned throughout the course to a practical cybersecurity task: Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) detection. We will use a dataset with **50k Base64-encoded binaries** downloaded from Praetorian’s “Machine Learning Binaries\" challenge web page [1]. Each of the encoded binary string in this dataset consists of 88 characters (66 bytes) on average and belongs to one of the following **twelve architecture types: avr, alphaev56, arm, m68k, mips, mipsel, powerpc, s390, sh4, sparc, x86_64, and xtensa**.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will use two different feature extration models, **byte-histogram+endianness features and byte-level TF-IDF features**, to extract features from the binaries. Using these features, we will **train and test SVM, Logisitic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forrest** classification algorithms. As in the previous labs, all algorithms are evaluated by **accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score**.\n",
